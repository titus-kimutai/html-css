## my process
### Build with:
  - HTML
  - CSS
### What i learned
In this project i learned more about the use of differnt html tags, elements and my interesting part was the css part where i learned and played around with the use of paddings, margins and also how to align items and text in the center. This project really helped me to enhance my html and css skills.

to see how code snippet is added;

```html
<p>QR code scanner</p>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

The areas i would put more focus in my future projects is on styling by making sure to enable my webpage responsive and also learn more about css styles since in the above project i got some challenges while dealing with making the webpage responsive.
